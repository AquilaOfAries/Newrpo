<h1>Interest in IT</h>
<h2 style="color:blue;"> • What is your interest in IT?<br> When did your interest in IT start?<br> Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?<br> Outline your IT experience (if any). </h2>
<p style="font-size:200%;">My interest in IT is the possibilities that can be explored and the challenges that I will face with the prospect of what I can create with the knowledge given to me by this course. The interest in IT probably began when I started playing games on my family pc. The pc was not immensely powerful for gaming, so a lot of the time I would watch tutorials on YouTube on how to reduce the graphics in games, by going through the game files and recoding it. From there I just did coding classes at school and technology classes. </p>
<h2 style="color:blue;">• Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </h2>
<p style="font-size:200%;" >Why I chose RMIT because I went through open university, I was looking for IT courses to do with the ATAR I got which wasn’t amazing, I found this course and the pre requirements were only the 2 starting classes so I jumped on that wagon. </p>
<h2 style="color:blue;"> • What do you expect to learn during your studies </h2>
<p style="font-size:200%;" >I believe that I will advance me knowledge in the IT in programming and improve what I know about different technologies and maybe become interested in a certain area.</p>
